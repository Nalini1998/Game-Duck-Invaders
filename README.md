# Game Duck Invaders

In this project, we’re going to take the skills we’ve learned from our Phaser physics lesson and create our own version of Space Invaders.

<br>

Since this game uses some of the mechanisms of the one we created in the Phaser Physics lesson, we’re porting over some of our previous code and building on top of it. So before starting, make sure to check over the comments and get an understanding of what’s already in the game.

<br>

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.
